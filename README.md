# Financial-Data
Using the sample finance dataset from powerBI and superstore dataset from tableau, I have cleaned and transformed the datasets using Power Query editor. Analysed the data and created some KPIs(Key Performance Indicators). Created some visuals like variety of charts. Finally created a dashboard to show a summary of the analysis and connected everything via bookmarks and drill through filters.

Tool used : PowerBI

Here is the screenshot of the dashboard:
